# vie library
This is the vienna C++ user group's sample implementation of a C++ standard library.

# Purpose
The implementation is our training ground where we are implementing the standard library for teaching purposes. It is incomplete and we are not aiming at a 100% accurate or complete implementation. Instead we are focusing on understanding the concepts and ideas behind the C++ standard library by implementing it: learning by doing. 

This branch has been created to compare the implementation of iterators by hand to using Boost.Iterators.

# Warranty
This library is no production-ready code and does not aim to be used in production environments.
